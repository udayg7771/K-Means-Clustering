# K-Means-Clustering

K-means++ improves the standard K-means algorithm by ensuring a smarter initialization of centroids, leading to better clustering quality. Instead of random initialization, K-means++ selects initial centroids in a way that maximizes their separation, reducing the chances of poor clustering.

Initialization Steps:

1. Select the first centroid randomly from the data points.
2. Compute the distance of each data point from the nearest chosen centroid.
3. Select the next centroid with a probability proportional to its distance from the nearest centroid.
4. Repeat until all k centroids are chosen.

Applications include : 
 Image segmentation: K-means++ can be used to segment images into different regions based on their color or texture features. 
 Customer segmentation: K-means++ can be used to group customers into different segments based on their purchasing habits, demographic data, or other characteristics. 
 Anomaly detection: K-means++ can be used to identify outliers or anomalies in a dataset. This is useful in fraud detection, network intrusion detection, and other security applications.
